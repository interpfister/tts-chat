Use this library to type text to speak. Built for use with Virtual Audio Cable to enable text to speech on conference calls.

First install Virtual Audio Cable: http://vb-audio.pagesperso-orange.fr/Cable/

Then launch your phone application (e.g. Zoom or Skype) and set the virtual audio cable as your input.

Then launch this application and use it to type text for your conference call. This will enable you to listen to the audio but type text to speak. Very useful for quiet places where you can't talk!

Usage:
Run `npm install` to download dependencies.

Run `npm start` to launch the application.
